### Developer Manual
How to install your application and all dependencies
- Our application is installed as a Node.js server. Node.js is required, as well as sqlite3, and the NPM google module as well as an API key is required for the map feature.

How to run your application on a server
- Our application can be ran by running 'node server.js' in a Powershell terminal with dependencies installed. 

How to run any tests you have written for your software
- To test our server, go to 'localhost:3000', type 'test' within the search bar, and **CLICK THE SUBMIT BUTTON**

The API for your server application - all GET, POST, PUT, etc endpoints, and what they each do
- The GET endpoint is used for the all businesses page. It receives data from the sqlite server.
- The POST endpoint is used for the index search. The data in the search bar is received and is used in an SQL command to gather relevant businesses.


A clear set of expectations around known bugs and a road-map for future development.
- Pressing 'enter' while on the search bar will not successfully search, the submit button must be used. 
- The POST request is not secure, and SQL injection could be used to break the sqlite server. 

FUTURE WORK:
- Accepting and displaying reviews for individual businesses
- Displaying business information on map
